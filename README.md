# Code-Quiz

## Bootcamp homework #4

A project requires a timed online quiz featuring multiple-choice questions (amended from the coding-based focus of the assignment). The following "Acceptance Criteria" for this feature were requested and have now been implemented:

- Clicking the button to start the quiz initiates a countdown timer and the presentation of the first question.
- When a question is answered -- correctly or not -- the next question appears.
- When the question is answered _incorrectly_, time is subtracted from the countdown timer.
- When all questions are answered OR the timer reaches "0", the game ends.
- Upon completion of the game, the player can choose to save their initials and score and compare their results against other scores (locally-logged).

Additionally, there are no errors in the console when it is inspected using Chrome DevTools
and the Javascript includes comments.
